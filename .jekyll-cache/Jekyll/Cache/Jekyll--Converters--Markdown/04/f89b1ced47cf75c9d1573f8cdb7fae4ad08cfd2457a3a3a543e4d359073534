I"û<p>[Last year I accepted 4 invitations to lecture in 4 different cities (New Haven, College Station, Nashville and Pittsburgh) on 4 different subjectsâ€¦ without noticing they were all on the same weekend. Considering Iâ€™m unlikely to have an actual lecture series anytime soon, I decided to make the best of the occasion and rolled my own by connecting the talks around an overarching narrative. What you see below is more or less what I said, emphasis on less; or even better, what you see below was <em>inspired</em> by the recent adventure. The post is cross-posted on <a href="http://laic.columbia.edu/blog/sentimental-education-the-humanities-part/">the LAIC departmentâ€™s blog</a> in support of their wonderful re-imagining of a departmental site.]</p>
