I"(<p>For the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve been working with some colleagues to develop a model for incorporating the full digitization of a scholarly work into a literature course. The process goes from scanning to OCR to tagging. The goal is for students to learn some of the basics of digital humanities while producing image-text PDFs and TEI-lite versions of works that might be publishable online in the future. Below is a sample of the student handout. This version of the handout is meant for the tagging of a 200-300 page scholarly work to be done by a team of 4-5 students. You can download and use a full version of the <a href="/docs/tags-handout.pdf" target="_blank">the handout here</a>. In the next few weeks, I will be working on developing a similar model meant for primary texts, so stay tuned.</p>
