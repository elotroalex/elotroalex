I"_<p>For years, I’ve dreamt of writing a piece with this title. I’d just never had a legit academic excuse to do so… until now. I’m writing on an airplane over the Atlantic, after a five-day editoria-palooza for the critical/genetic edition of Aimé Césaire’s complete works due from <em>Planète Libre</em> in 2013. The team directly in charge of establishing the text is about 12-13 deep, and all of us were locked at the CNRS for about 8-9 hours a day while Paris mockingly continued outside room 124. Now, I’ve been a member of the editorial team long enough to vouch that Césaire scholars/editors are indeed an agonistic and motley crew. As you can imagine, already three days in, we were starting to feel team-lag. This is how I explain the passion that went into a debate between me and Prof. Jean Jonaissant over, you guessed it, a comma.</p>
