I"À<p>Colleagues in North America have a lot to learn about the possibilities of the digital world from my colleagues down in the global south. Sometimes, when we feel we know a tool well, someone comes along and uses it in a strange and exciting new way. I have experienced this in my own work, where I have discovered some uses off the beaten path for theÂ <a href="http://www.juxtasoftware.org/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.juxtasoftware.org/">Juxta collation tool</a>. Thinking about the different global approaches to new media, I was struck in particular by the way Dominican intellectuals and artist used Facebook as a full-blown publishing platform. Iâ€™ve been toldÂ that this might be a Caribbean-wide phenomenon. Sadly, Facebook limits you to a bubble of â€˜friendsâ€™ that makes it difficult for me to survey too far afield. Of course, I am limited also because my approach to â€˜friendingâ€™ is radically different than the one being used by those publishing work on Facebook. While I have to excuse each acceptance based on some personal narrativeâ€”which privileges the random acquaintance at the coffee shop over those interested in my workâ€”my counterparts amass followings based on interest.</p>
