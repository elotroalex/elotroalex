I"Í<p>As Iâ€™ve argued <a href="https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac%3A152915" target="_blank">elsewhere</a>, CÃ©saireâ€™s early career revolves around several networks of collaborators in the Americas. At the time I made that argument, thinking I was already breaking some ground, I thought that CÃ©saireâ€™s collaborations only extended as far as the United States and the Caribbean. Apparently I needed to dig a bit deeper. A couple of months ago I unearthed one of his short pieces, â€œPoÃ¨me,â€ reprinted in 1945 in <em>Lettres franÃ§aises</em>, the literary journal published in Buenos Aires during the war period under the editorship of French thinkerer R. Caillois.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> More recently, Pierre Laforgue and I, working together, were able to track down a reprint of another poem, â€œSoleil Serpent,â€ to <em>Leitmotiv: BoletÃ­n De Hechos &amp; Ideas</em>, published in Santiago de Chile in 1943.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

      <p><em>Lettres franÃ§aises</em> was published under the imprint of <em>Sur</em> with the help of Victoria Ocampo, â€œ<em>la mujer mas Argentina</em>,â€ as Borges would call her. Borges himself appears in the journal on a few occasions. Besides CÃ©saire and Borges, many other important writers of the time left their imprint on its pages, making it one of the most important French language journals of the war period.Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <p>This will be the subject of an upcoming post on CÃ©saire and the culture of reprint that fueled the internationalization of surrealism. Stay tuned.Â <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
