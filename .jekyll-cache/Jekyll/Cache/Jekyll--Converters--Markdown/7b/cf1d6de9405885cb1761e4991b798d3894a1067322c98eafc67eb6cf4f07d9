<p>Iâ€™m finally settling back into my Câ€™ville routine. My last stop this winter break was the MLA convention in Seattle. Like many of my colleagues, I also felt that â€œ<a href="http://publishing.umich.edu/2012/01/16/mpub-mla/" title="MPub @ MLA" target="_blank">the MLAâ€™s heart (like a post-holiday Grinch) grew at least three sizes over the four days of the 2012 conference</a>.â€ While last year echoed <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/pannapacker-at-mla-digital-humanities-triumphant/30915" title="DH Triumphant">a prominent informer</a>â€˜s assessment that DH was â€œthe next big thingâ€ with anxiety, this year felt more like â€œHey, I like that. How do I do it?â€ This was especially a good year for those in the business of <a href="http://www.uvasci.org/current-work/" title="SCI" target="_blank">rethinking the future of graduate methods training</a> (ahem, ahem) and of <a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/" title="#Alt-ac" target="_blank">graduate futures in general</a>. Needless to say, I felt really great about being part of the first cohort of <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org">Praxis</a>.</p>

<p>Saturday evening I had a chance to catch up with one of my early undergraduate mentors. He had questions. He wanted to know what I knew about the DH world. Iâ€™m sure half of his curiosity came out of an earnest desire to hear the tale of my travels. The other half was a shrewd (and responsible) move to build a vocabulary for conversations his department will inevitably have this year with the dean, other departments, the library, etc: Can an isolated DHer work well with limited resources? Do you need a center? How do you get graduate students involved? Our conversation went on for a good three hours and it was very rewarding to offer a candid assessment of the field from where Iâ€™m standing.</p>

<p>I also realized that where Iâ€™m standing is what in battle we would call <em>higher ground</em>. I donâ€™t mean the privilege of hobnobbing with the enormous DH talent we have on grounds. Nothing, of the sort. Although projects are a whole different affair, you could develop decent DH <em>skills</em> 
and <em>ideas</em> were you connected from <a href="http://freecabinporn.com/" target="_blank">Pie Town</a>. I mean the privilege of seeing graduate methods transformation first-hand. I agree with <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/digital-humanities/project-management-and-graduate-training/" target="_blank">Brooke</a> that there is a continuum that links us to analog models in the department (at least at UVa). But the continuum does eventually lead to new ground.</p>

<p>What Iâ€™ve seen, of course, has been well recorded by all the Praxis bloggers. If this is your first time hearing about Praxis and you are interested in the fresh air blowing our way, I encourage you to <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/blog/archives/">read moreâ€¦</a></p>
