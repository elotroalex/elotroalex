I"È<p>Iâ€™m obviously still a sucker for a moving finale. In the case of this novel I was a sucker for the whole thing. Written in very simple prose, almost as if the book was a series of screenshots, the story has time to develop through an A, B, C and then F plot that I had not come across in a while. In a sense, the simplicity was refreshing. A few dream sequences here and there, strange nightmares, dotted the otherwise crystalline storyline. Donâ€™t be fooled though. A series of complexities underlines the straight-shooting. First, I would argue, is the role of English itself in a novel that deals with the advent of Westernization at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Chiew-Siah obviously has a sympathetic ear for Walter Scottâ€™s brethren, and apparently she started writing the thing under Alasdair Grayâ€™s tutelage. Then thereâ€™s the question of the inside and the outside, the self-contained world and the chopstick intrusions from the outside as Real.</p>
