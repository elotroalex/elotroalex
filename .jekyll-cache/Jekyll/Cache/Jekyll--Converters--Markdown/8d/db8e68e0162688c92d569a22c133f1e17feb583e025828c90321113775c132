I"Û<p>As part of the administrations‚Äôs cosmetic budget cuts, president Obama signed a bill on March 2 to eliminate all direct federal funding for the <a href="http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/resource/3507">National Writing Project</a> (NWP). I heard about this unfortunate decision through <a href="http://classroots.org/">Chad Sansing</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chadsansing">@chadsansing</a>) who has been an active part of <a href="http://coopcatalyst.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/the-blog4nwp-archive/">a national campaign</a> to attract bloggers to the issue (#blog4nwp). As many bloggers have already pointed out, and many studies show, the NWP program is one of those rare programs that <a href="http://speedchange.blogspot.com/2011/03/funding-what-works-national-writing.html">actually works</a>. <a href="http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/doc/about.csp">The Project</a> runs ‚Äúa network of sites anchored at colleges and universities‚Äù <a href="http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/doc/findasite/home.csp">across the nation</a>, which in turn ‚Äúprovide professional development, develop resources, generate research, and act on knowledge to improve the teaching of writing and learning in schools and communities early childhood to the university.‚Äù There are two things that stand out about the NWP for me: a) Their advocacy of writing as a necessary constituent of the democracies, our democracy of the future, and b) Their awareness of the paradigm shift brought about by new media technologies.</p>
