I")<p>Welcome. I am the Digital Scholarship Librarian at Columbia University, where I collaborate with faculty, students and library professionals in humanities research, pedagogy and knowledge production that involves the use of advanced computation, digital media design or network technologies. I am a proud co-coordinator for the <a href="https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/">Butler Library Studio</a> at Columbia University Libraries, a tech-light, library innovation space focused on digital scholarship and pedagogy, and now a broadcast, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/culstudio">Studio Remote</a>. I’m co-founder and moderator of <a href="http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/">Columbia’s Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities</a>, a vibrant trans-disciplinary research cluster focused on experimental humanities—where many of the projects highlighted below come from. I am also one of the creators and main editors of <em><a href="http://archipelagosjournal.org/">archipelagos journal</a></em>, a journal of Caribbean Digital Studies, and co-wrangler of its sister conference series, <a href="http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/">The Caribbean Digital</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests include Caribbean culture and history, with a focus on twentieth century poetry; digital humanities and technology design for different infrastructural and socio-economic environments; and, the relations of power and material extent of the cultural and scholarly record.</p>
