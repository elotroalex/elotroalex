I"R<p>The history of this novel is as rife with injustice as its contents. Having been famous for not having been read by anyone, the novel is probably not even a novel. The ‘thing’ is very episodic, with only a few reoccurring characters whose lives don’t really amount to a plot. If there is a main character here it would probably have to be the conglomerate of border-dwellers, a sort of brute leviathan, two faced-perhaps, attached to one giant bloody body. The message is anti-absolutist no doubt, but in between you can also hear anti-nationalist possibilities calling out.</p>
