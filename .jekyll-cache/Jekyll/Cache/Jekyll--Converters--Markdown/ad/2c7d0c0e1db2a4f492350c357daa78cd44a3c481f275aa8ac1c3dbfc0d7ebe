I"˜<p>Around here we usually wake up around 6:30 am to Henryâ€™s complaints. He asks to be let out of the room, but has not learned how to open the door himself. Iâ€™m sitting on the couch in the living room with half an eye closed. Henry stares at me with an impish face covered with ink. In a father-son compromise meant to give me the time to write this blogpost, I gave him a rare treat: pen and paper.</p>
