I"‹<p><em>[What follows is a response to a recent *Hybrid Pedagogy</em> article making the rounds. It serves as <a href="http://roopikarisam.com/2015/04/20/revise-and-resubmit-an-unsolicited-peer-review/">a companion piece to one by Roopika Risam</a>.* <em>We both took time away from writing articles for a digital humanities collection that solicited scholarship engaging with questions of race and difference to write these responses. Roopika and I wrote separately and come to these issues with different experiences within the field. Our interests only occasionally overlap but happily co-exist within the universe of digital humanities].</em></p>
