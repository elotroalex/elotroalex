I"<p>I just submitted the final draft of my dissertation, “Migrant Textuality: On the fields of Aimé Césaire’s <em>Et les chiens se taisaient</em>,” to my committee. My defense is scheduled for November 26 at noon at the University of Virginia English Department.</p>

<p>Let’s not waste too much time. Here’s <a title="Migrant Textuality Final Draft" href="https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac%3A161180" target="_blank">a PDF copy</a> of the document I submitted. Let’s go ahead an offer these documents with a CC-BY 3.0 license, why don’t we.</p>

<p>Ater the defense, I will work to create an online version of the dissertation more suitable for reading on a browser. That should take me a few weekends… I hope.</p>

<p>Have at it!<br />
