Try squeezing 30 years of your life into 3 pages, and maybe then you will understand what 3000 years of Chinese history feels like on 300 pages. Somehow though, J.A.G. Roberts pulls it off. The book never leaves you feeling like this or that period was shortchanged. On the contrary, you leave the reading well satisfied, sort of the way you feel after a 4-course meal followed by an espresso and a cigarette. If you supplement the reading with literary samples from the different periods (I used The Norton Anthology of World Literature) and full-color historical maps (Rand McNally), you&#8217;re in for quite a ride.
