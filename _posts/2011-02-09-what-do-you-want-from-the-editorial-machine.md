Here’s the main question: If you start out with a series of transcriptions or TEI texts and you want to build an online scholarly edition, what would you like an editorial machine to do for you?

Here’s why I ask: Working with the support of <a href="http://www.nines.org/" target="_blank">NINES </a> and Nick Laiacona, we are considering a series of grant proposals to transform <a href="http://www.juxtasoftware.org/" target="_blank">Juxta</a> from an analytical tool to a representational tool (i.e. an online scholarly edition maker) and yes, follow along to a more open environment. So, as my initial gesture of openness, I want to invite you to do one of two things:

  * Leave a comment below. Knowing what we now know, what would you like the ideal online scholarly edition to be?
  * Comment, tweak, critique, add to, step on <a href="https://docs0.google.com/document/d/1OExYAtyMFlOy7FlJlRcxHfxI6LqkzwzqseKMkp7o9jQ/edit?authkey=CLWyu-oP#" target="_blank">this collaborative brainstorm.</a>
