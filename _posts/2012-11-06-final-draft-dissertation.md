I just submitted the final draft of my dissertation, &#8220;Migrant Textuality: On the fields of Aimé Césaire&#8217;s *Et les chiens se taisaient*,&#8221; to my committee. My defense is scheduled for November 26 at noon at the University of Virginia English Department.

Let&#8217;s not waste too much time. Here&#8217;s <a title="Migrant Textuality Final Draft" href="https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac%3A161180" target="_blank">a PDF copy</a> of the document I submitted. Let&#8217;s go ahead an offer these documents with a CC-BY 3.0 license, why don&#8217;t we.

Ater the defense, I will work to create an online version of the dissertation more suitable for reading on a browser. That should take me a few weekends&#8230; I hope.

Have at it!
