Welcome. I am the Digital Scholarship Librarian at Columbia University, where I collaborate with faculty, students and library professionals in humanities research, pedagogy or knowledge production that involves the use of advanced computation, digital media design or network technologies. I am the proud lead coordinator for the [Butler Library Studio](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University Libraries, a tech-light, library innovation space focused on digital scholarship and pedagogy, and now a broadcast, [Studio Remote](https://www.twitch.tv/culstudio). I'm co-founder and moderator of [Columbia's Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/), a vibrant trans-disciplinary research cluster focused on experimental humanities---where many of the projects highlighted below come from. I am also one of the creators and main editors of *[archipelagos journal: a journal of Caribbean digital praxis](http://archipelagosjournal.org/)*, and co-wrangler of its sister conference series, [The Caribbean Digital](http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/). 

My research interests include Caribbean culture and history, with a focus on twentieth century poetry; digital humanities and technology design for different infrastructural and socio-economic environments; and, the relations of power and material extent of the cultural and scholarly record. 

Below is a selection of some of my digital scholarship and public initiatives. For selected open access articles, visit [the Archive section]({{site.baseurl}}/archive/). For a complete profile you can downloand a copy of [my Curriculum Vitae]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gil-cv.pdf){: target="blank"}.
